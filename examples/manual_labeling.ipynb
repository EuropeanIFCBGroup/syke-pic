    "Labeling is done by selecting a class from the dropdown menu. Each class that you select images, gets a directory with the images in it. You can select where these \"class directories\" are stored when you click `End`. The class `New_Class` is intended to be a temporary name for a novel class not in the current listing. Be sure to manually rename the `New_Class` directory after use. "
